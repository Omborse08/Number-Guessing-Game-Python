## 🎯Number Guessing Game in Python
This is a beginner-friendly Python project — a **number guessing game** that uses `while` loops, `for` loops, `lists`, and basic logic. The user has to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of tries, and the game tracks scores across multiple rounds.


## 🛠️Features
- Random number generated between 1 and 20
- 3 Rounds of gameplay
- Each round starts with a score of 10
- Each wrong guess reduces score by 1
- Feedback like **"Too Big"** or **"Too Small"**
- Top 3 scores displayed at the end


## 🚀How to Run
Make sure Python is installed.
```bash
python guess_game.py
```


## 📸Sample Output
Round 1
Guess the number (1-20): 10
Too Small
Guess the number (1-20): 15
Correct.
> Your Score is 9

All Scores from 3 Rounds: [9, 10, 7]

Top 3 Scores:
1. 10
2. 9
3. 7
